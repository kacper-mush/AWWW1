# Lothric, Younger Prince

## Basic information:
Lothric, Younger Prince is a Lord of CinderÂ and Boss in Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 3 Lothric, Younger Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Lothric and Lorian easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Lothric, Younger Prince and Lorian, Elder Prince boss. Lothric is a purely magical boss and is a force to be reckoned with while he's accompanied by his brother and partner boss Lorian, Elder Prince. He is a tall hooded figure with the most notable feature being his spindly arms, and is the only of the twin princes to speak during cutscenes. While he isn't fought during the first phase, after depleting Lorian's healthbar once, Lothric teleports to his brother's side and clings to his back for the remainder of the fight.
