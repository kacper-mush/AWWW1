# Oceiros, the Consumed King

## Basic information:
Oceiros, the Consumed King is a Boss in Dark Souls 3 (DKS3). This Dark Souls 3 Oceiros Boss Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Oceiros, the Consumed King easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Oceiros boss. Oceiros is found in the garden below Lothric Castle, guarding a shrine.

It can be assumed that he is blind (like Seath), as his eye sockets are empty, and he makes references to this throughout the fight. He is a very vocal boss, and talks of an invisible or imaginary baby which he cradles in his arm for the first half of the fight. Oceiros initially attacks the player with a staff, but after being brought down to a certain health threshold, gets down on all fours and attacks like a wild beast.
