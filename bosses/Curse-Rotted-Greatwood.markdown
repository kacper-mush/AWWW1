# Curse-Rotted Greatwood

## Basic information:
Curse-Rotted Greatwood is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Curse-Rotted Greatwood Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Curse-Rotted Greatwood easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Greatwood boss.

The Curse-Rotted Greatwood is a giant tree with human-like limbs. It is covered in sacs that act as the hitbox of the boss. When the player encounters it, they will find several undead worshippers in the arena that will fight alongside it during combat. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, instead of going through a transformation, the battle arena changes. This massive tree is filled with curses, and is the object of worship for the Undead Settlement's inhabitants.

Players should find the Mound-Makers covenant before defeating this boss, or they will need extra steps to enter the covenant. It is recommended to bring a weapon with long reach to deal with the Curse-Rotted Greatwood quickly. This boss is optional, but must be defeated for the Transposing Kiln required for Soul Transposition.

Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that drop Boss Souls capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, and Items for the player.
