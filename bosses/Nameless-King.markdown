# Nameless King

## Basic information:
Nameless King and King of the Storm are an optionalÂ Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Nameless King Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat the Nameless King and King of the Storm easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Nameless King boss. The Nameless King is an imposing armored humanoid who rides atop a blue wyvern and attacks players with his spear. During the first phase of the boss fight, he is referred to as the "King of the Storm," reflecting his formidable mount. In this phase, the wyvern plays a significant role in the battle, using its own powerful attacks to challenge the player.

Once the wyvern is killed, the fight transitions into the second phase, and the boss's name changes to the "Nameless King." In this phase, the Nameless King dismounts and engages the player directly, showcasing his full power and combat prowess. The transition marks a dramatic shift in the battle's dynamics, requiring the player to adapt their strategy to overcome the Nameless King's enhanced attacks and aggressive behavior.
