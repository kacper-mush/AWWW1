Champion Gundyr is a different version of Iudex Gundyr, however he utilizes the same moveset as Iudex Gundyr with the addition of new attacks.

After being brought down to a certain health threshold, rather than undergoing a physical transformation, his eyes glow red and begins attacking the player much more aggressively.
