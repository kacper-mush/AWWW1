Champion Gundyr is a different version of Iudex Gundyr, however he utilizes the same moveset as Iudex Gundyr with the addition of new attacks. He is much more aggressive than he was in the Cemetery of Ash. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, rather than undergoing a physical transformation, his eyes glow red and begins attacking the player much more aggressively.
