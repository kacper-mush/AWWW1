## Basic information:
Crystal Sage is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Crystal Sage Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Crystal Sage easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Crystal Sage boss.
<br>

The Crystal Sage is a large humanoid covered in loose sorcerer\'s robes and wears a mage\'s hat big enough to cover their face. They mainly cast spells using a magical orb, but may attack players that get too close to them with their rapier. Players should be alert when approaching their arena as the boss fight starts as soon as they enter. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, the boss will start spawning clones that resemble themself very closely, save for the difference in the color of their magic.
<br>

Speed is key in this boss fight \- knowing how to manage your Stamina can make fighting this boss easier. This boss is not optional and they must be defeated to proceed to the Cathedral of the Deep. Not to be confused with the mini\-boss version located in the Grand Archives. You can summon Eygon of Carim after saving Irina of Carim to aid you in combat. His summon sign appears behind a pillar in the room immediately prior to the Crystal Sage fight. Note that if you purchase any dark miracles from Irina or defeat the Abyss Watchers, then his sign will not appear.

Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that drop Boss Souls capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, and Items for the player.
