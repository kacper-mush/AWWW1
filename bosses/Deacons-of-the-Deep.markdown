## Basic information:
Deacons of the Deep is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Deacons of the Deep Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat the Deacons of the Deep easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Deacons of the Deep boss.
<br>

The Deacons of the Deep are a group of clerics that wield candlesticks in combat. Some wield their weapon similar to that of a sword, while others use it as a catalyst for pyromancy. This congregation of clerics defends a roaming soul, that is eventually revealed to be the Archdeacon after being brought down to a certain health threshold.
<br>

Fighting the Deacons of the Deep is relatively straightforward, though players should position themselves well in order not to get swarmed and overwhelmed. You can summon Anri of Astora and Sirris of the Sunless Realms / Horace the Hushed for this fight \(it is possible to summon all three by using Dried Finger\). This boss fight is not optional and must be defeated to obtain the \"small doll\", which serves as a key item to traverse through the magic barrier sealing off the entry to Irithyll of the Boreal Valley.
<br>

Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that drop Boss Souls capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, and Items for the player.
