Vordt of the Boreal Valley is a large quadrupedal creature wearing heavy knights armor and many of the attacks in his moveset features a great hammer that resembles a mace. When players encounter him, he is seen walking out of an orb of fog. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, the blue mist around him and his weapon intensifies, slowly inflicting Frostbite onto the player if they stand close to him. This is the first instance of frostbite the player may encounter in the game.
